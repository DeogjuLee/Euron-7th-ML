.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  No hestitation,

                                      I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23

                                           We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car

affordable, comfortable, reliable vehicle .\\n26                                                                                                                                                     You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?\\n28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                    The seats were very comfortable .\\n38                                                                                                                                         The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                 I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior

previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                  Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51

                                                        I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

                                                         Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64

                    The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

           The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99

interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort

.\\n49                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n50                                                                                                                                                       My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n51

                                      I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23

                                           We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car

                                                             I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29

       I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35

reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                 I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41

month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior

previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                        I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                   It is very quiet and comfortable .\\n55

                  My friends say my car is just like a Lexus and I have to agree, very comfortable and beautiful .\\n63                                                                                                                                           Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64

         Turns out, it was one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides ever .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                             It is very reliable and

quiet ride with low levels of road and wind noise .\\n73                                                                                                                                                            The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable, quite and smooth ride .\\n77

quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats

great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91

           The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of

wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n27

from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n29

level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

         I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                                     The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

the Navigon .\\n40                                                                                                                          After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

                                      there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car .\\n1

They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4

pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\\n5

that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order \\u0096 we\\u0092d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11                                                                                                                               Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                               I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .\\n13

                                                     However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

                                                    Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25

.\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28

                                                                                           Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31

.\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                       This total includes the taxes and

                                                        Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43

pay for their parking .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower

charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

                                                   all these hotels charge parking fees .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                  Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71

contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74

.\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                  You'll be having

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

  It's fast to acquire satellites .\\n0    If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                       The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It picks up the satellites quickly  , routes fast, has good animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The revised chipset allows the GPS to make satellite connections quickly .\\n4                                                                                                                                                The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .\\n6                                                                                                                                                         On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Satellite lock, up and navigation precision was better for TomTom, e .\\n12                                                                                                                                                         I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .\\n17                                                                                                                                                               SATELLITE RECEPTION, , Being in downtown Charlotte with skyscrapers surrounding me, the Nuvi maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage   .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                                          On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                         If the  hot fix  satellite performance is supposed to be fast, I'd hate to see the older versions without it .\\n20

the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .\\n54

my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .\\n56

satellite signal connection .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                               Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58

capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59

It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .\\n61

which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6                                                                                                                                  After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                         These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .\\n8

it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .\\n27   Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

          I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

                                                                Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user

                                           My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55

putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the

last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .\\n38

                                                                        The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

usually take is the Navigon .\\n40                                                                                                                          After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

streets .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  The estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .\\n43                                                                                                                          Accuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .\\n44

                                 Accuracy is determined by the maps .\\n45

a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n48

remotest areas .\\n49                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n50

with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .\\n52

                                                    Building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor, so very quiet and no hall noise .\\n13

to keep it .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !\\n54

                                Great location but rooms need some work .\\n55

beautiful .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                 He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .\\n57

asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                          When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .\\n60

we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .\\n61                                                                                                                                              very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .\\n62

                                                              from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .\\n66

4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms

                                  The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107

place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113

well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116

should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117

rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119

and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .\\n104

there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cluster_label\",\n

like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .\\n74

come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra \\u00a312 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .\\n76

   Some of the Asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .\\n7

                                                           Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .\\n8

              The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Surfing the net is a breeze, but I did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11

bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12

expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13

have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

     I've had the 1005HA, PU1X for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .\\n30

                    The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n31

                          My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .\\n32

glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Once I configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .\\n41

excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way\\n43

either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

                                                                                                                                                                                 Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

     The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55

sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n114

was kinda small for me, so the thing I did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .\\n116

press F11 and the screen will enlarge, giving you some additional freedom and space .\\n117

able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

smaller than a regular one .\\n141

getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural

fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

                 I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .\\n159

extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\n161                                                                                                                             This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

probably the biggest drawback .\\n164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .\\n167

                                                                                                                                                Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

my bigger laptop except a large screen .\\n174

was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

.\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55



The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

different room .\\n63

                                                                                                                         Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle

                                                The nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which I hadn't expected in a large chain hotel .\\n16

around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19

mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

                                                                                                                                                                                   There were Italian,

room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .\\n25

                                       Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28

got spilt .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                             Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

                                   There is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby .\\n33

                   The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .\\n35                                                                                                                                  Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                           If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .\\n42

.\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44

significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english'

                        It even tells you the speed limit on most roads .\\n3                                                                                                                               The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n4                                                                                                          Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n5

.\\n8                                                                                                                                  Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7 .\\n9

next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n11

sub, optimal routes .\\n12                                                 For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13                                                                                                     If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                        SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is .\\n17

                                                       On the lower left hand side, this unit shows the maximum speed limit for the road you are traveling .\\n19

this will help to avoid the risk of getting a speeding ticket .\\n20

                                                           And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                  When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed .\\n24                                                                                                                     I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26

bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed

amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n53

limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .\\n55

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .\\n69

After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

                                       I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh,

.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20

major improvement .\\n21

pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .\\n25                                                                                                                                              Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

                                                                                                                                                                                           It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .\\n29

                                                                                                                                 if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

better .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                   With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

lot less sensitive .\\n34

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

up the dictionary, starting with that entry .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .\\n39                                                                                                      The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

                                  Every K2 button has a satisfying \\n42                                                                                                                                       Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43                                                                                        The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .\\n46

            The buttons and the controller work smoothly .\\n55                                                                                           Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                              I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .\\n57

                                                                                                                                           Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

.\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                             With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .\\n76

.\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

           My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84

                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86

                                               Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

                                                        My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book

would flicker a bit when I hit a button, but that was all .\\n162
